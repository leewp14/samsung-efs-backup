# samsung-efs-backup
/efs backup for my family's Samsung handset

## Structure
/efs backup files are organized by device codename. 
First four digits of file name indicates the last 4 IMEI number of device. 

## About
This is for my personal use only. 

Since the binary file inside /efs is encrypted (which stores your IMEI info), there's no way for you to edit it and set your own IMEI inside it. 

Should you want to repair your corrupted /efs, use Octoplus Box software.
